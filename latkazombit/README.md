# Lätkäzombit

Lätkäzombit is the game where the KiiGame project originated from. It still serves as the reference game for the engine.

The game is in the Finnish language.

## Development

To run typecheck and unit tests, the engine needs to be bundled first:

```
cd kiigame
npm run build
cd ../latkazombit
npm run typecheck
npm test
```
